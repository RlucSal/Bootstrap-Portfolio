# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description 

### Develop a portfolio that satisties the following  acceptable criteria:

1. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
2. A navigation bar
   A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.
   Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
   Links should navigate to the appropriate sections.
3. A hero section
   A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
4. A work section
   A section displaying your work in grid.
   Use Bootstrap cards for each project. The description should give a brief overview of the work.
   Each project will eventually link to your class project work!
5. A skills section
   List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
6. An about/contact section
   An About Me section in the same row.
7. A footer section
8. All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
9. All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.
10. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
11. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
    
### Motivation 

1. A portfolio is more than just a compilation of projects; it's a narrative of a life's work. It's a place to weave the story of a journey, experiences, and the passions that drive ourselfs. 

2. A portfolio is a digital business card. It demonstrates expertise, skills, and  commitment. It's a window for potential clients, employers, and collaborators to peek into our world and witness your capabilities.

3. In a world where digital presence is vital, a well-crafted portfolio sets us apart. It showcases our dedication to our profession and the time that we invested in our personal brand. It's an opportunity to shine in a crowded digital space.

4. It's a reflection of our growth and development over time. It's not just a showcase of our work; it's a testimony to our progress and a reminder of our potential.

5. A portfolio isn't just about self-promotion; it's about sharing our knowledge, inspiring others, and building meaningful connections.
